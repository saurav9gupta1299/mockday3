        <h1>1. Difference between flex row and column</h1>
        <p>flex-direction: row -  It is the sub property of flex which is the property of CSS used to display items on horizontal axis in row manner. We can reverse the row order in flex.
        Syntax: div {
                        display: flex;
                        flex-direction: row;
                    }
                
        flex-direction: column- It is the sub property of flex which is the property of CSS used to display items on vertical axis in column manner. Similar to row, we can reverse the column order in flex.
        Syntax: div {
                        display: flex;
                        flex-direction: column;</p>
        <h1>2.Explain inline,internal and external stylesheet</h1>
       <p>
        Inline CSS is used to apply CSS on a single line or element.<br>
        Internal CSS is used to apply CSS on a single document or page. It can affect all the elements of the page. It is written inside the style tag within head section of html.<br>
        External CSS is used to apply CSS on multiple pages or all pages. Here, we write all the CSS code in a css file. Its extension must be .css for example style.css.<br>

       <h1>3.Justify-content allows you to do what</h1>
       <p>justify-content allows you to position the grid within it's grid container. </p><br>
       <h1>4.Difference between absolute and relative positioning</h1>
       <p>Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position.<br> Absolute - the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent.</p>
       <h1>5.What is grid template column used for</h1>
       <p>The grid-template-columns property specifies the number (and the widths) of columns in a grid layout. The values are a space separated list, where each value specifies the size of the respective column.</p><br>
       <h1>6.What is z-index in CSS</h1>
       <p>The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.<br>
        z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements).</p><br>
        <h1>7.What is the difference between padding and margin</h1>
        <p>Margin: It is the space around an element. Margins are used to move an element up or down on a page as well as left or right.<br> Margin is completely transparent, and it does not have any background color. It clears the area around the element. Each side of the element has a margin size you can change individually. In creating the gap, the margin pushes adjacent elements away.<br>
        <p>Padding: It is the space between the element and the related content inside it.<br> It determines how elements look and sit within a container. It also shows the container background around the element in it.<br> Padding can be affected by background colors as it clears the area around the content. To create the gap, it either grows the element size or shrinks the content inside. By default, the size of the element increases.<br></p>
